Prework for The Iron Yard 

Hi All,
I am just a guy trying to make a career change into the great world that is Frontend Web Development! I am really excited about it and I hope to be using github a lot more in the next few months. One interesting thing about me is that I met the whole cast of the first Harry Potter movie once. It was most likely the best day of my life.
